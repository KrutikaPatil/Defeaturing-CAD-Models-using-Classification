# Masters Thesis on Defeaturing CAD models using classification techniques

Complex CAD models are simplified by suppressing detailed geometric features before being used for downstream engineering applications. A lot of this simplification is done manually. The objective of the project was to use machine learning techniques to build a prototype system for identification of suppressible geometric features. A comprehensive dataset was generated through extensive FEA simulations. A feedforward neural network architecture was used to solve the classification problem. \\
